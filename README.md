# Transportation Cost Watch 2024 - Nigeria  

## Description  
This project analyzes **transportation costs in Nigeria for the year 2024**, focusing on different modes of transport, including **motorcycles, buses, air travel, and water transport**. Using **Power BI and Excel**, the data was **cleaned, processed, prepared, analyzed, shared, and visualized** to provide insights into transportation trends, cost variations, and areas for improvement in Nigeria’s transport system.  

## Data Processing Workflow  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and formatted data using **Power BI and Excel**.  
- **Data Transformation**: Computed **average, minimum, and maximum** costs for different transport modes.  
- **Data Validation**: Ensured data accuracy before visualization.  
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive **Power BI dashboards** for trend analysis.  
- **Insights & Reporting**: Identified **cost trends, areas for improvement, and policy recommendations**.  

## Key Metrics Analyzed  
1. **Motorcycle Transport Cost**:  
   - **Average cost per drop**  
   - **Minimum and maximum journey cost per drop**  

2. **Bus Transport Cost (Intercity & State)**:  
   - **Average, minimum, and maximum charges**  

3. **Air Transport Cost**:  
   - **Minimum, maximum, and average charges for single journeys on specific routes**  

4. **Water Transport Cost**:  
   - **Minimum, maximum, and average transport charges**  

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI** (Data Cleaning, Processing, Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting)  
- **Excel** (Data Preparation and Processing)  

## Insights & Conclusion  
This project provides a **data-driven analysis of Nigeria’s transportation system**, highlighting **cost variations across different transport modes and routes**. The insights help **government agencies, policymakers, and transport businesses** make informed **decisions on transportation infrastructure and pricing improvements**.
